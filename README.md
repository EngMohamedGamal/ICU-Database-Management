Intensive Care Unit Database Management System (Front-End)

Welcome to the ICU Database Management project! This is a front-end system designed to manage the data of an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the ICU database.

In an ICU, the management of patient information and medical data is crucial. This project aims to simplify the process of managing and accessing the ICU database. With this system, medical professionals can easily view, add, update, and delete patient records, as well as perform various administrative tasks related to the ICU.

Once the application is running, you can use the interface to perform various tasks related to ICU database management. Here are some common actions:

  Patient Management: Add new patients by filling in their details, view patient records by searching for specific patients, update patient information by editing the relevant   fields, and delete patient records if necessary.
  
  Staff Management: Manage the staff members by adding new staff, updating their details, and removing staff members when needed.
  
  Administrative Tasks: Generate reports on patient statistics, manage user accounts and their permissions, and configure system settings such as the database connection.
